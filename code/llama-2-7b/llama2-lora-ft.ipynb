    "# Fine-Tuning Llama 2 using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)\n",
    "Llama 2 has gained traction as a robust, powerful family of Large Language Models that can provide compelling responses on a wide range of tasks. While the base 7B, 13B, and 70B models serve as a strong baseline for multiple downstream tasks, they can lack in domain-specific knowledge or proprietary or otherwise sensitive information. Fine-tuning is often used as a means to update a model for a specific task or tasks to better respond to domain-specific prompts. This notebook walks through preparing a dataset and using Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the base Llama 2 7B model from Hugging Face against the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of LoRA is based on the paper, [LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=nZeVKeeFYf9) by Hu et al.\n",
